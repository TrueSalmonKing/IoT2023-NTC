Next steps:
	Use SVM to classify the traffic into malicious and benign using the selected features
	Check for the accuracy using different metrics and features
	Plot the results
	Check for performance improvement using different classifiers and fine tunning methods (optional)

Extensions:
	Possible use of tshark in order to livetest the classifier against both malicious and benign classification (DDoS, Ping, DNS)
	Testing with different datasets
